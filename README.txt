This is an offline backup copy of the Doodle Champion Island Games by google and 4studios.

Right now, it does work but has an issue with fullscreen that won't work (it stays in windowed mode instead).

The game has been modified to forcefully load the english text.

On Firefox, you can just open the kitsune20.html (you may have to change a setting for that though).
On Chromium and other web browsers, you will need to host your own HTTP server.
Do :
python3 -m http.server

On linux. You can also use Apache
